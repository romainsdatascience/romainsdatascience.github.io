You have landed on the website I have created in my honour. Other than its self-idolatry end, its main purpose is to gather the data science projects I have undertaken.

This being said, if you want to:
* Know a bit more about myself, go to "About".
* Walk through my portfolio of data science projects, go to "Portfolio"
* Have a look to my Curriculum Vitae, go to 'CV'

I hope you will enjoy the reading.

Do not hesitate to contact me.
