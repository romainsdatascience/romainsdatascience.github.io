I am a graduate from the Solvay Brussels Schools of Economics and Management with a Master in Business Engineering. During my studies I developed a business mindset, communication skills and my entrepreneurial spirit. Moreover, it provides me with the analytical background necessary to tackle Data Science tasks.

Although it is during my studies that I was initiated to programming and Data Science, it is during my exchange at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore that my interest in Data Science flourished. Jumping from e-learning and Kaggle notebooks to the study of statistical learning books in my university library, I learned as much as I could about data science and more particularly about machine learning.

My biggest passions are: running and graphic novels. I know it is not original... Nevertheless, these hobbies take much of my free time. Thanks to running I can compensate for the long hours I spend sitting on a chair and reading enables me to be someone else for few hours... (Not really... I just like it and find it relaxing)
