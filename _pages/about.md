I am a graduate from the Solvay Brussels Schools of Economics and Management with a Master in Business Engineering. During my studies I developed a business mindset, communication skills and an entrepreneurial spirit. Moreover, it provides me with the analytical background necessary to tackle Data Science tasks.

Although it is at university that I was initiated to programming and Data Science, it is during my exchange program at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore that my interest in Data Science flourished. Since then, I am jumping from e-learning and Kaggle notebooks to statistical learning books. I learned as much as I could about data science and more particularly about machine learning.

During most of my free time, you will find me running/cycling or reading graphic novels. Thanks to running I can compensate for the long hours I spend sitting on a chair in front of my computer. One of the things I love about reading is to discover the worlds that are created by the authors and the different ways they address a topic.

Also, I like to keep it short.
